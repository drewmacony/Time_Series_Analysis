## Time Series Regression Analysis of Grocery Store Performance

### 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes and forecasts grocery store performance using time series regression models. The objective is to understand historical sales patterns, identify key factors driving performance, and provide actionable insights to optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies.

### 📝 Key Features
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Clean and preprocess historical sales, foot traffic, promotions, and external data (holidays, weather).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends, seasonality, and anomalies to understand underlying patterns in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create lagged variables, moving averages, and seasonality indicators to enhance model performance.
- **Modeling Approaches:**
  - Baseline Models: Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA.
  - Advanced Models: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Prophet, and machine learning techniques like XGBoost and LSTM.
  - Time Series Regression: Analyze the impact of past performance and external factors on future sales.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like MAE, MSE, and MAPE for accuracy assessment, and perform Time Series Cross-Validation.
- **Forecasting and Insights:** Generate forecasts and provide data-driven recommendations for store operations and marketing strategies.
- **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards and visual reports to communicate key findings.

### 📦 Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python (pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn), R (forecast, tsibble)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau
- **Data Storage and Retrieval:** SQL, CSV, Excel

### 📈 Use Cases
- **Sales Forecasting:** Predict future sales to optimize stock levels and reduce waste.
- **Promotional Analysis:** Evaluate the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.
- **Seasonality Insights:** Understand seasonal effects on sales to plan inventory and staffing.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns in data for proactive decision-making.
